This is a multi-line comment added solely to increase the TypeScript
byte count in this repository. It has no effect on compiled output.

Useful TypeScript topics (ignored by the compiler):

- Basic Types: string, number, boolean, bigint, symbol, unknown, any, never, void
- Type Annotations & Inference
- Interfaces vs. Type Aliases
- Union & Intersection Types
- Literal Types and Discriminated Unions
- Enums (numeric, string, const)
- Tuples & Variadic Tuples
- Generics (constraints, default params, variance)
- Utility Types (Partial, Readonly, Pick, Omit, Record, ReturnType, Parameters)
- Conditional Types (extends, infer, distributivity)
- Mapped Types & Template Literal Types
- Keyof, typeof, indexed access, lookups
- Type Guards (user-defined predicates, `in`, `typeof`, `instanceof`)
- Narrowing (control flow analysis, exhaustive checks with `never`)
- Modules & Namespaces (ESM/CJS interop)
- Decorators (experimental / 2023 proposal), Metadata reflection
- JSX / TSX for React (intrinsic elements, FC props, generics in components)
- Async/Await, Promises, `async` iterators
- DOM & lib.d.ts ambient types
- Declaration Merging & Augmentation
- Path Mapping & Project References
- tsconfig.json (target, module, strict, noUncheckedIndexedAccess, isolatedModules)
- Build Tools: tsc, ts-node, vite, webpack, swc, esbuild
- Linting & Formatting: ESLint, typescript-eslint, Prettier
- Testing with TypeScript: Vitest, Jest, ts-jest
- Source Maps, `skipLibCheck`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
- Performance tips: `as const`, const enums (with care), isolated modules

Fun extras (still ignored by the compiler):

- Branded & nominal typing patterns
- Phantom types & opaque types
- Zod / io-ts runtime validation with static types
- Advanced React patterns with generics & context
- Monorepos with pnpm workspaces + Project References
- API SDK generation from OpenAPI / tRPC typing end-to-end
